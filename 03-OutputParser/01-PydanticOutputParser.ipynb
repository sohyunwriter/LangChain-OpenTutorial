    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This tutorial covers how to perform ```PydanticOutputParser``` using ```pydantic```.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ```PydanticOutputParser``` is a class that helps transform the output of a language model into **structured information** . This class can **provide the information you need in a clear and organized form** instead of a simple text response.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "By utilizing this class, you can transform the output of your language model to fit a specific data model, making it easier to process and utilize the information\n",
    "\n",
    "### Main Method\n",
    "\n",
    "A ```PydanticOutputParser``` primarily requires the implementation of **two core methods**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **```get_format_instructions()```**: Provide instructions that define the format of the information that the language model should output. \n",
    "For example, you can return instructions as a string that describes the fields of data that the language model should output and how they should be formatted. \n",
    "These instructions are very important for the language model to structure the output and transform it to fit your specific data model.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **```parse()```**: Takes the output of the language model (assumed to be a string) and analyzes and transforms it into a specific structure. \n",
    "Use a tool like Pydantic to validate the input string against a predefined schema and transform it into a data structure that follows that schema.\n",
