        "\n",
        "\n",
        "`FAISS` is a library designed for the efficient similarity search and clustering of dense vectors. It provides robust algorithms for searching vector sets of any size, including those that may not fit entirely in `RAM`.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "In addition to the core search functionality, `FAISS` includes support code for evaluation and parameter tuning, making it a versatile tool for various applications in machine learning and artificial intelligence.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "----\n",
        "Key Benefits:\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "- Efficient Large-Scale Search:\n",
        "`FAISS` ensures fast and accurate vector searches, even with millions of high-dimensional vectors.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "- Memory Optimization:\n",
        "Offers advanced quantization techniques to reduce memory usage without sacrificing performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "- Customizable Search Accuracy:\n",
        "Users can fine-tune parameters to balance between search accuracy and speed according to specific requirements.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "- Versatile Applications:\n",
        "From machine learning to AI-powered recommendation systems, Faiss supports a wide range of use cases.\n",

        "To effectively integrate `FAISS` into your workflow, follow these steps:\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Data Preparation:\n",
        "Prepare and normalize your data, ensuring vectors are in a dense representation format.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Index Creation:\n",
        "Select and build a Faiss index based on your dataset size and performance requirements. Common options include IndexFlat for brute-force search or IVF for scalable inverted file-based search.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Index Training (if needed):\n",
        "For certain indices, such as `IVF` or `PQ`, train the index with representative data samples to optimize performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Search Execution:\n",
        "Use the index to search for nearest neighbors, leveraging optional GPU acceleration for faster performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "5. Evaluation and Tuning:\n",
        "Test and evaluate the performance of your index, adjusting parameters like quantization levels or clustering size for improved results.\n",

        "    1. Internally calls the `similarity_search_with_score` method to search for documents along with their similarity scores.\n",
        "    2. Extracts and returns only the documents from the results, excluding the scores.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Key Features:\n",
        "    - The `filter` parameter enables metadata-based filtering.\n",
        "    - The `fetch_k` parameter allows control over the number of documents retrieved before filtering, ensuring enough documents remain after filtering.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Considerations:\n",
        "    - Search performance heavily depends on the quality of the embedding model used.\n",
        "    - In large datasets, it is important to adjust the values of `k` and `fetch_k` to balance search speed and accuracy.\n",
        "    - For complex filtering needs, pass a custom function to the `filter` parameter for fine-grained control.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Optimization Tips:\n",
        "    - Cache the results for frequently used queries to improve the speed of repeated searches.\n",
        "    - Avoid setting `fetch_k` too high, as it may slow down search performance. Experiment to find an appropriate value."

        "\n",
        "- Parameters:\n",
        "    - `target` (`FAISS`): The target `FAISS` object to be merged into the current object.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "- How It Works:\n",
        "    1. Checks if the document stores are compatible for merging.\n",
        "    2. Assigns new indices to the incoming documents based on the length of the existing index.\n",

        "\n",
        "\n",
        "- Key Features:\n",
        "    - Merges the indices, document stores, and index-to-document ID mappings of two `FAISS` objects.\n",
        "    - Maintains continuity of index numbering during the merge.\n",
        "    - Ensures compatibility of document stores before proceeding with the merge.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "**[Cautions]**\n",
        "- The structure of the target `FAISS` object must be compatible with the current object.\n",
        "- Be cautious of duplicate IDs, as the current implementation does not check for duplicates.\n",
        "- If an exception occurs during the merge process, it may leave the system in a partially merged state."
