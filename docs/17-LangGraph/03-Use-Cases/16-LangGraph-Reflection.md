## Overview

Reflection in the context of LLM-based agents refers to the process of prompting an LLM to observe its past steps and evaluate the quality of its decisions. This is particularly useful in scenarios like iterative problem-solving, search refinement, and agent evaluation.

In this tutorial, we will explore **how to implement a simple Reflection mechanism using LangGraph**, specifically to analyze and improve **AI-generated essays**.

### What is Reflection?

Reflection involves prompting an LLM to analyze its own previous responses and adjust its future decisions accordingly.

This can be useful in:

- **Re-planning**: Improving the next steps based on past performance.

- **Search Optimization**: Refining retrieval strategies.

- **Evaluation**: Measuring the effectiveness of a solution and iterating.

We will implement a **Reflection-based agent in LangGraph** that reviews its own responses and refines them dynamically.

## Defining the Reflection Graph

Now that we've implemented each step, we wire everything into a LangGraph workflow.

### 1. Define State

We establish a structured way to store and track messages. This ensures that each interaction, including generated essays and reflections, is retained in a structured manner for iterative improvements.

```python
from typing import Annotated, List, Sequence
from langgraph.graph import END, StateGraph, START
from langgraph.graph.message import add_messages
from langgraph.checkpoint.memory import MemorySaver
from typing_extensions import TypedDict


class State(TypedDict):
    messages: Annotated[list, add_messages]
```

### 2. Create Nodes

Two key nodes are defined—one for generating essays and another for evaluating them. The `generation_node` creates a structured essay, while the `reflection_node` critiques and suggests improvements.

```python
async def generation_node(state: State) -> State:
    return {"messages": [await generate.ainvoke(state["messages"])]}
```

```python
async def reflection_node(state: State) -> State:
    # Other messages we need to adjust
    cls_map = {"ai": HumanMessage, "human": AIMessage}
    # First message is the original user request. We hold it the same for all nodes
    translated = [state["messages"][0]] + [
        cls_map[msg.type](content=msg.content) for msg in state["messages"][1:]
    ]
    res = await reflect.ainvoke(translated)
    # We treat the output of this as human feedback for the generator
    return {"messages": [HumanMessage(content=res.content)]}
```

### 3. Set Conditional Loops

The workflow continues refining until a stopping criterion is met. In this case, after a few iterations, the graph stops the refinement process to prevent infinite loops.

```python
def should_continue(state: State):
    if len(state["messages"]) > 6:
        # End after 3 iterations
        return END
    return "reflect"
```

### 4. Compile and Execute

The LangGraph structure is compiled, allowing seamless AI-driven iteration. The process begins with the `generate` node and loops through the `reflect` node until the stopping condition is met.

```python
builder = StateGraph(State)
builder.add_node("generate", generation_node)
builder.add_node("reflect", reflection_node)
builder.add_edge(START, "generate")
builder.add_conditional_edges("generate", should_continue)
builder.add_edge("reflect", "generate")
memory = MemorySaver()
graph = builder.compile(checkpointer=memory)
```

### 5. Execute the Graph

The graph is now executed in an asynchronous streaming process, where an essay is generated, reflected upon, and improved iteratively.

```python
config = {"configurable": {"thread_id": "1"}}
```

```python
async for event in graph.astream(
    {
        "messages": [
            HumanMessage(
                content="Generate an essay on the ethical implications of artificial intelligence in decision-making"
            )
        ],
    },
    config,
):
    print(event)
    print("---")
```

<pre class="custom">{'generate': {'messages': [AIMessage(content='**Title: The Ethical Implications of Artificial Intelligence in Decision-Making**\n\nIn recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a transformative force across various sectors, from healthcare to finance, and even in governance. As AI systems increasingly take on decision-making roles traditionally held by humans, the ethical implications of this shift have become a focal point of discussion. This essay explores the ethical concerns surrounding AI in decision-making, including issues of bias, accountability, transparency, and the potential for dehumanization.\n\nOne of the most pressing ethical concerns regarding AI in decision-making is the issue of bias. AI systems are trained on vast datasets that often reflect historical inequalities and prejudices. When these biased datasets are used to train AI algorithms, the resulting systems can perpetuate and even exacerbate existing social injustices. For instance, in the criminal justice system, AI tools used for risk assessment have been shown to disproportionately target marginalized communities, leading to unfair sentencing and parole decisions. This raises critical questions about the fairness of AI-driven decisions and the moral responsibility of developers and organizations that deploy these technologies.\n\nAccountability is another significant ethical implication of AI in decision-making. When an AI system makes a decision that leads to negative outcomes, it can be challenging to determine who is responsible. Is it the developers who created the algorithm, the organizations that implemented it, or the AI itself? This ambiguity complicates the process of seeking justice for those adversely affected by AI decisions. The lack of clear accountability can lead to a culture of impunity, where harmful decisions are made without repercussions. Establishing frameworks for accountability is essential to ensure that AI systems are used responsibly and that individuals can seek redress when harmed.\n\nTransparency in AI decision-making processes is also a critical ethical concern. Many AI algorithms operate as "black boxes," meaning their internal workings are not easily understood, even by their creators. This lack of transparency can lead to mistrust among users and stakeholders, particularly when decisions significantly impact people\'s lives, such as in hiring or loan approvals. Ethical AI development necessitates that organizations prioritize transparency, allowing individuals to understand how decisions are made and to challenge them if necessary. This openness can foster trust and ensure that AI systems are held to ethical standards.\n\nMoreover, the increasing reliance on AI for decision-making raises the risk of dehumanization. As machines take over roles that require empathy, intuition, and moral judgment, there is a concern that human values may be sidelined. For example, in healthcare, AI systems may prioritize efficiency over patient-centered care, leading to a more transactional approach to treatment. This shift can undermine the human connection that is vital in many decision-making contexts, particularly those involving vulnerable populations. It is crucial to strike a balance between leveraging AI\'s capabilities and preserving the human elements that are essential to ethical decision-making.\n\nIn conclusion, the integration of artificial intelligence into decision-making processes presents significant ethical implications that must be carefully considered. Issues of bias, accountability, transparency, and dehumanization highlight the need for a robust ethical framework to guide the development and deployment of AI technologies. As society continues to embrace AI, it is imperative that stakeholders prioritize ethical considerations to ensure that these powerful tools serve to enhance, rather than undermine, human dignity and justice. By addressing these ethical challenges, we can harness the potential of AI while safeguarding the values that define our humanity.', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={'finish_reason': 'stop', 'model_name': 'gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_bd83329f63'}, id='run-5e9847b7-874f-4c3b-a76e-7ccad36c1963-0')]}}

This essay explores the ethical concerns surrounding AI in decision-making, including issues of bias, accountability, transparency, and the potential for dehumanization, while also considering potential solutions and counterarguments.\n\nOne of the most pressing ethical concerns regarding AI in decision-making is the issue of bias. AI systems are trained on vast datasets that often reflect historical inequalities and prejudices. For instance, a study by ProPublica revealed that an AI tool used for risk assessment in the criminal justice system was biased against African American defendants, falsely labeling them as higher risk for recidivism. This perpetuates existing social injustices and raises critical questions about the fairness of AI-driven decisions. To address this issue, developers must prioritize the use of diverse and representative datasets, as well as implement regular audits of AI systems to identify and mitigate bias. By fostering a more equitable approach to AI training, we can work towards reducing the harmful impacts of biased algorithms.\n\nAccountability is another significant ethical implication of AI in decision-making. When an AI system makes a decision that leads to negative outcomes, it can be challenging to determine who is responsible. This ambiguity complicates the process of seeking justice for those adversely affected by AI decisions. For example, in the case of autonomous vehicles, if an accident occurs, it is unclear whether the liability lies with the manufacturer, the software developer, or the vehicle owner. Establishing clear frameworks for accountability is essential to ensure that AI systems are used responsibly. One potential solution is to create regulatory bodies that oversee AI deployment and enforce accountability standards, ensuring that individuals can seek redress when harmed.\n\nTransparency in AI decision-making processes is also a critical ethical concern. Many AI algorithms operate as "black boxes," meaning their internal workings are not easily understood, even by their creators. This lack of transparency can lead to mistrust among users and stakeholders, particularly when decisions significantly impact people\'s lives, such as in hiring or loan approvals. To enhance transparency, organizations should adopt explainable AI (XAI) techniques that provide insights into how decisions are made. By making AI systems more interpretable, stakeholders can better understand the rationale behind decisions, fostering trust and ensuring that AI systems are held to ethical standards.\n\nMoreover, the increasing reliance on AI for decision-making raises the risk of dehumanization. As machines take over roles that require empathy, intuition, and moral judgment, there is a concern that human values may be sidelined. For example, in healthcare, AI systems may prioritize efficiency over patient-centered care, leading to a more transactional approach to treatment. This shift can undermine the human connection that is vital in many decision-making contexts, particularly those involving vulnerable populations.

    {'generate': {'messages': [AIMessage(content='**Title: The Ethical Implications of Artificial Intelligence in Decision-Making**\n\nIn recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a transformative force across various sectors, from healthcare to finance, and even in governance. As AI systems increasingly take on decision-making roles traditionally held by humans, the ethical implications of this shift have become a focal point of discussion. This essay explores the ethical concerns surrounding AI in decision-making, including issues of bias, accountability, transparency, and the potential for dehumanization, while also considering potential solutions and counterarguments.\n\nOne of the most pressing ethical concerns regarding AI in decision-making is the issue of bias. AI systems are trained on vast datasets that often reflect historical inequalities and prejudices. For instance, a study by ProPublica revealed that an AI tool used for risk assessment in the criminal justice system was biased against African American defendants, falsely labeling them as higher risk for recidivism. This perpetuates existing social injustices and raises critical questions about the fairness of AI-driven decisions. To address this issue, developers must prioritize the use of diverse and representative datasets, as well as implement regular audits of AI systems to identify and mitigate bias. Additionally, organizations like the AI Now Institute advocate for the establishment of ethical guidelines that mandate fairness assessments in AI applications. By fostering a more equitable approach to AI training, we can work towards reducing the harmful impacts of biased algorithms.\n\nAccountability is another significant ethical implication of AI in decision-making. When an AI system makes a decision that leads to negative outcomes, it can be challenging to determine who is responsible. This ambiguity complicates the process of seeking justice for those adversely affected by AI decisions. For example, in the case of autonomous vehicles, if an accident occurs, it is unclear whether the liability lies with the manufacturer, the software developer, or the vehicle owner. Establishing clear frameworks for accountability is essential to ensure that AI systems are used responsibly. One potential solution is to create regulatory bodies that oversee AI deployment and enforce accountability standards, ensuring that individuals can seek redress when harmed. Furthermore, companies can adopt a model of shared accountability, where all stakeholders involved in the AI lifecycle are held responsible for its outcomes.\n\nTransparency in AI decision-making processes is also a critical ethical concern. Many AI algorithms operate as "black boxes," meaning their internal workings are not easily understood, even by their creators. This lack of transparency can lead to mistrust among users and stakeholders, particularly when decisions significantly impact people\'s lives, such as in hiring or loan approvals. To enhance transparency, organizations should adopt explainable AI (XAI) techniques that provide insights into how decisions are made. For instance, companies like Google and IBM are developing tools that allow users to understand the rationale behind AI decisions. By making AI systems more interpretable, stakeholders can better understand the rationale behind decisions, fostering trust and ensuring that AI systems are held to ethical standards.\n\nMoreover, the increasing reliance on AI for decision-making raises the risk of dehumanization. As machines take over roles that require empathy, intuition, and moral judgment, there is a concern that human values may be sidelined. For example, in healthcare, AI systems may prioritize efficiency over patient-centered care, leading to a more transactional approach to treatment. This shift can undermine the human connection that is vital in many decision-making contexts, particularly those involving vulnerable populations. To mitigate this risk, it is crucial to strike a balance between leveraging AI\'s capabilities and preserving the human elements that are essential to ethical decision-making. Incorporating human oversight in AI-driven processes can help ensure that compassion and empathy remain integral to decision-making. Additionally, training AI systems to recognize and prioritize human values can help maintain the necessary balance between technology and humanity.\n\nIn conclusion, the integration of artificial intelligence into decision-making processes presents significant ethical implications that must be carefully considered.

    **Title: The Ethical Implications of Artificial Intelligence in Decision-Making**
    
    In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a transformative force across various sectors, from healthcare to finance, and even in governance. As AI systems increasingly take on decision-making roles traditionally held by humans, the ethical implications of this shift have become a focal point of discussion. This essay explores the ethical concerns surrounding AI in decision-making, including issues of bias, accountability, transparency, and the potential for dehumanization.
    
    One of the most pressing ethical concerns regarding AI in decision-making is the issue of bias. AI systems are trained on vast datasets that often reflect historical inequalities and prejudices. When these biased datasets are used to train AI algorithms, the resulting systems can perpetuate and even exacerbate existing social injustices. For instance, in the criminal justice system, AI tools used for risk assessment have been shown to disproportionately target marginalized communities, leading to unfair sentencing and parole decisions. This raises critical questions about the fairness of AI-driven decisions and the moral responsibility of developers and organizations that deploy these technologies.
    
    Accountability is another significant ethical implication of AI in decision-making. When an AI system makes a decision that leads to negative outcomes, it can be challenging to determine who is responsible. Is it the developers who created the algorithm, the organizations that implemented it, or the AI itself? This ambiguity complicates the process of seeking justice for those adversely affected by AI decisions. The lack of clear accountability can lead to a culture of impunity, where harmful decisions are made without repercussions. Establishing frameworks for accountability is essential to ensure that AI systems are used responsibly and that individuals can seek redress when harmed.
    
    Transparency in AI decision-making processes is also a critical ethical concern. Many AI algorithms operate as "black boxes," meaning their internal workings are not easily understood, even by their creators. This lack of transparency can lead to mistrust among users and stakeholders, particularly when decisions significantly impact people's lives, such as in hiring or loan approvals. Ethical AI development necessitates that organizations prioritize transparency, allowing individuals to understand how decisions are made and to challenge them if necessary. This openness can foster trust and ensure that AI systems are held to ethical standards.
    
    Moreover, the increasing reliance on AI for decision-making raises the risk of dehumanization. As machines take over roles that require empathy, intuition, and moral judgment, there is a concern that human values may be sidelined. For example, in healthcare, AI systems may prioritize efficiency over patient-centered care, leading to a more transactional approach to treatment. This shift can undermine the human connection that is vital in many decision-making contexts, particularly those involving vulnerable populations. It is crucial to strike a balance between leveraging AI's capabilities and preserving the human elements that are essential to ethical decision-making.
    
    In conclusion, the integration of artificial intelligence into decision-making processes presents significant ethical implications that must be carefully considered. Issues of bias, accountability, transparency, and dehumanization highlight the need for a robust ethical framework to guide the development and deployment of AI technologies. As society continues to embrace AI, it is imperative that stakeholders prioritize ethical considerations to ensure that these powerful tools serve to enhance, rather than undermine, human dignity and justice. By addressing these ethical challenges, we can harness the potential of AI while safeguarding the values that define our humanity.

    In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) has emerged as a transformative force across various sectors, from healthcare to finance, and even in governance. As AI systems increasingly take on decision-making roles traditionally held by humans, the ethical implications of this shift have become a focal point of discussion. This essay explores the ethical concerns surrounding AI in decision-making, including issues of bias, accountability, transparency, and the potential for dehumanization, while also considering potential solutions and counterarguments.
    
    One of the most pressing ethical concerns regarding AI in decision-making is the issue of bias. AI systems are trained on vast datasets that often reflect historical inequalities and prejudices. For instance, a study by ProPublica revealed that an AI tool used for risk assessment in the criminal justice system was biased against African American defendants, falsely labeling them as higher risk for recidivism. This perpetuates existing social injustices and raises critical questions about the fairness of AI-driven decisions. To address this issue, developers must prioritize the use of diverse and representative datasets, as well as implement regular audits of AI systems to identify and mitigate bias. Additionally, organizations like the AI Now Institute advocate for the establishment of ethical guidelines that mandate fairness assessments in AI applications. By fostering a more equitable approach to AI training, we can work towards reducing the harmful impacts of biased algorithms.
    
    Accountability is another significant ethical implication of AI in decision-making. When an AI system makes a decision that leads to negative outcomes, it can be challenging to determine who is responsible. This ambiguity complicates the process of seeking justice for those adversely affected by AI decisions. For example, in the case of autonomous vehicles, if an accident occurs, it is unclear whether the liability lies with the manufacturer, the software developer, or the vehicle owner. Establishing clear frameworks for accountability is essential to ensure that AI systems are used responsibly. One potential solution is to create regulatory bodies that oversee AI deployment and enforce accountability standards, ensuring that individuals can seek redress when harmed. Furthermore, companies can adopt a model of shared accountability, where all stakeholders involved in the AI lifecycle are held responsible for its outcomes.
    
    Transparency in AI decision-making processes is also a critical ethical concern. Many AI algorithms operate as "black boxes," meaning their internal workings are not easily understood, even by their creators. This lack of transparency can lead to mistrust among users and stakeholders, particularly when decisions significantly impact people's lives, such as in hiring or loan approvals. To enhance transparency, organizations should adopt explainable AI (XAI) techniques that provide insights into how decisions are made. For instance, companies like Google and IBM are developing tools that allow users to understand the rationale behind AI decisions. By making AI systems more interpretable, stakeholders can better understand the rationale behind decisions, fostering trust and ensuring that AI systems are held to ethical standards.
    
    Moreover, the increasing reliance on AI for decision-making raises the risk of dehumanization. As machines take over roles that require empathy, intuition, and moral judgment, there is a concern that human values may be sidelined. For example, in healthcare, AI systems may prioritize efficiency over patient-centered care, leading to a more transactional approach to treatment. This shift can undermine the human connection that is vital in many decision-making contexts, particularly those involving vulnerable populations. To mitigate this risk, it is crucial to strike a balance between leveraging AI's capabilities and preserving the human elements that are essential to ethical decision-making. Incorporating human oversight in AI-driven processes can help ensure that compassion and empathy remain integral to decision-making. Additionally, training AI systems to recognize and prioritize human values can help maintain the necessary balance between technology and humanity.
    
    In conclusion, the integration of artificial intelligence into decision-making processes presents significant ethical implications that must be carefully considered. Issues of bias, accountability, transparency, and dehumanization highlight the need for a robust ethical framework to guide the development and deployment of AI technologies. By prioritizing diverse datasets, establishing accountability frameworks, adopting explainable AI techniques, and ensuring human oversight, stakeholders can address these ethical challenges. As society continues to embrace AI, it is imperative that we safeguard the values that define our humanity, ensuring that these powerful tools enhance rather than undermine human dignity and justice. Policymakers, developers, and organizations must actively engage in ethical AI practices, prioritizing human values in their work to foster a more equitable and compassionate future. By addressing these ethical concerns, we can harness the potential of AI while promoting a society that values both innovation and ethical responsibility.
