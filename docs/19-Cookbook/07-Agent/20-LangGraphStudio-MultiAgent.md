## Overview

This notebook demonstrates how to build a **Multi-agent workflow** by integrating `LangChain` with `LangGraph Studio`, allowing you to orchestrate multiple specialized agents for gathering, analyzing, and synthesizing information. In this tutorial, we focus on researching a specific person, their professional background, and the company they work for, as well as generating relevant follow-up questions or interview prompts.

By visualizing this agent workflow in `LangGraph Studio`, you can easily debug, modify, and extend the pipeline. Each agent‚Äôs output can be inspected step by step, making it straightforward to add new components or adjust the process flow.

## What is LangGraph Studio

`LangGraph Studio` offers a new way to develop LLM applications by providing a specialized agent IDE that enables visualization, interaction, and debugging of complex agentic applications.

With visual graphs and the ability to edit the state, you can better understand agent workflows and iterate faster. `LangGraph Studio` integrates with LangSmith so you can collaborate with teammates to debug failure modes.

To use LangGraph Studio, make sure you have a [project with a LangGraph app](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/cloud/deployment/setup/) set up.

The desktop application only supports `macOS`. Other users can run a local LangGraph server and use the `web studio`. 

We also depend on `Docker Engine` to be running, currently we only support the following runtimes:

- [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
- [Orbstack](https://orbstack.dev/)

LangGraph Studio requires Docker-compose version 2.22.0+ or higher. 

Please make sure you have `Docker Desktop` or `Orbstack` installed and running before continuing.

In this tutorial, we have installed and are using `Docker Desktop` as our container runtime environment.

### Jupyter Notebook Code Cell Extractor

This script converts `Jupyter Notebook` cells into a `Python script` with the following features:
1. Converts pip install magic commands into executable Python code
2. Removes or comments out visualization-related code
3. Handles cell deduplication
4. Processes cells up to the graph compilation
5. Maintains code organization and readability

This conversion is necessary because `LangGraph Studio` requires Python `(.py) file`s for execution. This script helps transform our tutorial notebook into the correct format while maintaining all functionality.

Key Features:
- Automatic package installation code generation
- Cell content deduplication
- Selective cell processing
- Magic command handling
- Proper formatting for `LangGraph Studio` compatibility

# How to connect a local agent to LangGraph Studio

**Connection Options**
There are two ways to connect your local agent to LangGraph Studio:

- [Development Server](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/langgraph_studio/#development-server-with-web-ui): Python package, all platforms, `no Docker`
- [LangGraph Desktop](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/langgraph_studio/#desktop-app): `Application`, `Mac only`, `requires Docker`

In this guide we will cover how to use the development server as that is generally an easier and better experience.


[LangGraph Studio Desktop (Beta)](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph-studio)

Currently, the desktop application only supports only macOS. Other users can [run a local LangGraph server and use the web studio](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/tutorials/langgraph-platform/local-server/#langgraph-studio-web-ui). We also depend on Docker Engine to be running. Currently, we support only the following runtimes:

[LangGraph Studio Download for MacOS](https://studio.langchain.com/)

### Setup your application

First, you will need to setup your application in the proper format. This means defining a langgraph.json file which contains paths to your agent(s). See [this guide](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/application_structure/) for information on how to do so.

Please make sure that all the required files for running LangGraph Studio are located in the `langgraph_studio` folder.

For this example, we will use this example [repository](https://github.com/langchain-ai/langgraph-example) here which uses a `requirements.txt` file for dependencies:

```bash
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ langgraph_studio 
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .env
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ langgraph.json
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ output_script.py
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements.txt
```

As previously mentioned, we are using `Docker Desktop` , so please download it, launch the app, and make sure the Docker engine is running. Then, in `LangGraph Studio` , open the langgraph_studio folder.
