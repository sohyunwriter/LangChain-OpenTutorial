### GoogleNews

The **GoogleNews** class is the utility for fetching and parsing news from Google News RSS feeds. Here's a concise explanation of its key features:

**Core Functionality**

- **News Retrieval**
    - Fetches news articles from Google News RSS feeds
    - Supports both latest news and keyword-based searches
    - Returns structured data in a consistent format (URL and content)

- **Main Methods**
    - `search_latest()`: Retrieves the most recent news articles
    - `search_by_keyword()`: Searches news based on specific keywords

**Usage Example**

```python
# Initialize the news client
news = GoogleNews()

# Get latest news
latest = news.search_latest(k=3)

# Search by keyword
results = news.search_by_keyword("artificial intelligence", k=5)
```

The class handles URL encoding, RSS feed parsing, and error cases automatically, making it ideal for integration with news monitoring systems or AI agents that need access to current news content.

```python
import feedparser
from urllib.parse import quote
from typing import List, Dict, Optional


class GoogleNews:
    """
    A class for searching and retrieving Google News results.
    Provides methods to fetch latest news and search by keywords using Google News RSS feeds.
    """

    def __init__(self):
        """
        Initialize the GoogleNews class.
        Sets up the base URL for Google News RSS feed.
        """
        self.base_url = "https://news.google.com/rss"

    def _fetch_news(self, url: str, k: int = 3) -> List[Dict[str, str]]:

        """
        news_data = feedparser.parse(url)
        return [
            {"title": entry.title, "link": entry.link}
            for entry in news_data.entries[:k]
        ]

            return []

        result = []
        for news in news_list:
            result.append({"url": news["link"], "content": news["title"]})

        return result

    def search_latest(self, k: int = 3) -> List[Dict[str, str]]:

        news_list = self._fetch_news(url, k)
        return self._collect_news(news_list)
```

### AgentStreamParser
The AgentStreamParser is a utility class designed to handle and process the output stream from AI agents. Here's a concise explanation of its key features:

**Core Functionality**
- **Stream Processing**
    - Parses and processes agent actions, observations, and results in real-time
    - Handles three main types of events:
        1. Tool calls (when agents use tools)
        2. Observations (agent's findings)
        3. Final results (agent's conclusions)

- **Callback System**
    - The class uses three main callbacks:
        - Tool callbacks for monitoring tool usage
        - Observation callbacks for tracking agent findings
        - Result callbacks for handling final outputs

**Usage Example**

```python
# Create parser with default callbacks
parser = AgentStreamParser()

# Process agent output
parser.process_agent_steps({
    "actions": [...],  # Agent actions
    "steps": [...],    # Observation steps
    "output": "..."    # Final result
})
```

This parser is particularly useful for debugging agent behavior, logging agent actions, and maintaining a clear record of the agent's decision-making process.

```python
from typing import Any, Dict, List, Callable
from dataclasses import dataclass
from langchain_core.agents import AgentAction, AgentStep
from langchain.agents.output_parsers.tools import ToolAgentAction


# Callback function executed when a tool is called.
def tool_callback(tool) -> None:
    print("[Tool Call]")
    print(f"Tool: {tool.get('tool')}")  # Print the name of the tool used.
    if tool_input := tool.get("tool_input"):  # If there are input values for the tool
        for k, v in tool_input.items():
            print(f"{k}: {v}")  # Print the key and value of the input.
    print(f"Log: {tool.get('log')}")  # Print the tool execution log.


# Callback function to print observation results.
def observation_callback(observation) -> None:
    print("[Observation]")
    print(
        f"Observation: {observation.get('observation')}"
    )  # Print the observation content.


# Callback function to print the final result.
def result_callback(result: str) -> None:
    print("[Final Answer]")
    print(result)  # Print the final answer.


@dataclass
class AgentCallbacks:
    """
    A dataclass containing callback functions for the agent.

    Attributes:
        tool_callback (Callable[[Dict[str, Any]], None]): Callback function called when using tools

## How to Use FileManagementToolkit

**FileManagementToolkit** is a toolkit for local file management operations that:
- Automates file management tasks
- Enables AI agents to manipulate files safely
- Provides comprehensive file operation tools

### Security Considerations
When using **FileManagementToolkit**, implement these security measures:
- Limit directory access using `root_dir`
- Configure filesystem permissions
- Use `selected_tools` to restrict available operations
- Run agents in sandboxed environments

### Main Components
**File Management Tools**
- `CopyFileTool` : Create a copy of a file in a specified location.
- `DeleteFileTool` : Delete a file.
- `FileSearchTool` : Recursively search for files in a subdirectory that match the regex pattern.
- `MoveFileTool` : Move or rename a file from one location to another.
- `ReadFileTool` : Read file from disk.
- `WriteFileTool` : Write file to disk.
- `ListDirectoryTool` : List files and directories in a specified folder.

**Settings**
- `root_dir` : Set the root directory of workflows.
- `selected_tools` : Select the tools you want to use.

**Dynamic Tool Creation**
- `get_tools` : create instances of the selected tools.

### 1. Basic Setup
The **FileManagementToolkit** provides essential file operation capabilities with security considerations. Let's explore how to set it up and use it safely.

```python
from langchain_community.agent_toolkits import FileManagementToolkit

# Set the working directory to a directory named 'tmp'.
working_directory = "tmp"

# Create a FileManagementToolkit object.
# Initialize toolkit with root directory
toolkit = FileManagementToolkit(root_dir=str(working_directory))

# Call the toolkit.get_tools() method to retrieve all available file management tools.
available_tools = toolkit.get_tools()

# Display available tools
print("[Available File Management Tools]")
for tool in available_tools:
    print(f"- {tool.name}: {tool.description}")
```

<pre class="custom">[Available File Management Tools]
    - copy_file: Create a copy of a file in a specified location
    - file_delete: Delete a file
    - file_search: Recursively search for files in a subdirectory that match the regex pattern
    - move_file: Move or rename a file from one location to another
    - read_file: Read file from disk
    - write_file: Write file to disk
    - list_directory: List files and directories in a specified folder
</pre>

**Selective Tool Access**
-  For better security, you can restrict available tools: 

```python
# Initialize toolkit with selected tools only
tools = FileManagementToolkit(
    root_dir=str(working_directory),
    selected_tools=["read_file", "file_delete", "write_file", "list_directory"],
).get_tools()
tools
```




<pre class="custom">[ReadFileTool(root_dir='tmp'),
     DeleteFileTool(root_dir='tmp'),
     WriteFileTool(root_dir='tmp'),
     ListDirectoryTool(root_dir='tmp')]</pre>



### 2. File Operations
 Let's explore basic file operations using the toolkit's tools. Each operation demonstrates a core file management functionality. 

```python
# Unpack tools for easier access
read_tool, delete_tool, write_tool, list_tool = tools


# Create a new file with content
write_tool.invoke({"file_path": "example.txt", "text": "Hello World!"})
```




<pre class="custom">'File written successfully to example.txt.'</pre>



```python
# Check current directory contents
print(list_tool.invoke({}))
```

<pre class="custom">example.txt
</pre>

```python
# Remove the created file
print(delete_tool.invoke({"file_path": "example.txt"}))
```

<pre class="custom">File deleted successfully: example.txt.
</pre>

```python
# Verify file removal
print(list_tool.invoke({}))
```

<pre class="custom">No files found in directory .
</pre>

### 3. Advanced Usage (News Articles)
Below, we combine file management with news retrieval to create and organize news articles: 

```python
from langchain_core.tools import tool
from typing import List, Dict
import re


# Function to clean filenames by removing invalid characters and making them filesystem-safe
def sanitize_filename(filename: str) -> str:
    """
    Sanitize filename by removing invalid characters.

    Args:
        filename (str): Original filename
    Returns:
        str: Sanitized filename
    """
    # Remove or replace invalid characters with underscore
    sanitized = re.sub(r'[<>:"/\\|?*]', "_", filename)
    # Remove leading/trailing periods or spaces for additional safety
    sanitized = sanitized.strip(". ")
    return sanitized


# Tool for writing news articles to files with proper formatting and sanitized filenames
@tool
def write_news_file(title: str, content: str, url: str) -> str:
    """
    Write news content to a file with a sanitized filename.

    Args:
        title: News title
        content: News content
        url: News URL
    Returns:
        str: Result message
    """
    # Create safe filename from the title
    safe_filename = sanitize_filename(title) + ".txt"

    # Format the content with title, body, and URL
    formatted_content = f"Title: {title}\nContent: {content}\nURL: {url}"

    # Get the write tool and create the file
    write_tool = next(tool for tool in tools if tool.name == "write_file")
    write_tool.invoke({"file_path": safe_filename, "text": formatted_content})

    return f"Created file: {safe_filename}"


# Define the latest news search tool.
@tool
def latest_news(k: int = 5) -> List[Dict[str, str]]:
    """Look up latest news"""
    # Create a GoogleNews object.
    news_tool = GoogleNews()
    # Search for the latest news and return the results. k indicates the number of news items to return.
    return news_tool.search_latest(k=k)


# Use the FileManagementToolkit to retrieve file management tools.
tools = FileManagementToolkit(
    root_dir=str(working_directory),
    selected_tools=[
        "copy_file",
        "file_delete",
        "file_search",
        "move_file",
        "read_file",
        "write_file",
        "list_directory",
    ],
).get_tools()

# Add custom tools
tools.extend([latest_news, write_news_file])

# Confirm which tools are available
tools
```




<pre class="custom">[CopyFileTool(root_dir='tmp'),
     DeleteFileTool(root_dir='tmp'),
     FileSearchTool(root_dir='tmp'),
     MoveFileTool(root_dir='tmp'),

     WriteFileTool(root_dir='tmp'),
     ListDirectoryTool(root_dir='tmp'),
     StructuredTool(name='latest_news', description='Look up latest news', args_schema=<class 'langchain_core.utils.pydantic.latest_news'>, func=<function latest_news at 0x000002225925F880>),
     StructuredTool(name='write_news_file', description='Write news content to a file with a sanitized filename.\n\nArgs:\n    title: News title\n    content: News content\n    url: News URL\nReturns:\n    str: Result message', args_schema=<class 'langchain_core.utils.pydantic.write_news_file'>, func=<function write_news_file at 0x000002225925E700>)]</pre>



 Set up the agent with appropriate tools and configuration: 

```python
from langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
from langchain.agents import create_tool_calling_agent, AgentExecutor
from langchain_community.chat_message_histories import ChatMessageHistory
from langchain_core.runnables.history import RunnableWithMessageHistory

# Create a prompt describing tool usage
# The prompt provides the agent with text describing the tasks the model should perform (names and roles of tools).
prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages(
    [
        (
            "system",
            "You are a helpful assistant. "
            "Make sure to use the `latest_news` tool to find latest news. "
            "For each article, use the `write_news_file` tool to save it safely. "
            "The write_news_file tool will automatically handle filename sanitization.",
        ),
        ("placeholder", "{chat_history}"),
        ("human", "{input}"),
        ("placeholder", "{agent_scratchpad}"),
    ]
)

# Create the LLM
llm = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o-mini")

# Create an agent configured to call the tools
agent = create_tool_calling_agent(llm, tools, prompt)

# AgentExecutor for structured operation
agent_executor = AgentExecutor(
    agent=agent,
    tools=tools,
    verbose=False,
    handle_parsing_errors=True,
)


# Retrieve or create a session's chat history
def get_session_history(session_ids):
    if session_ids not in store:  # If session_id is not in store
        # Create a new ChatMessageHistory object and store it
        store[session_ids] = ChatMessageHistory()
    return store[session_ids]  # Return the session history for the specified session ID


# Create a runnable agent with a chat history
agent_with_chat_history = RunnableWithMessageHistory(
    agent_executor,
    # Chat session_id
    get_session_history,
    # Key for input messages in the prompt
    input_messages_key="input",
    # Key for history messages in the prompt
    history_messages_key="chat_history",
)

agent_stream_parser = AgentStreamParser()
```

**Example Operations**

1. Fetch and Save News

```python
# Request the agent to fetch and store news articles
result = agent_with_chat_history.stream(
    {
        "input": "Search for the latest 5 news articles, create a file for each news article with the title as the filename (.txt), "
        "and include the content and URL of the news in the file."
    },
    config={"configurable": {"session_id": "abc123"}},
)


print("Agent Execution Result:")

for step in result:

    agent_stream_parser.process_agent_steps(step)
```

<pre class="custom">Agent Execution Result:

### 4. Error Handling Examples
To ensure robust file operations, wrap your tool calls with a safe operation function: 

```python
def safe_file_operation(operation_func, **kwargs):
    """
    Wrapper function for safe file operations with comprehensive error handling.
    """
    try:
        # Tools expect a single input dictionary
        return operation_func(input=kwargs)
    except FileNotFoundError:
        return "Error: File not found"
    except PermissionError:
        return "Error: Permission denied"
    except IsADirectoryError:
        return "Error: Path is a directory, not a file"
    except Exception as e:
        return f"Unexpected error: {str(e)}"


# Example usage with correct argument structure
def demonstrate_file_operations():
    # Writing to a protected directory
    result1 = safe_file_operation(
        write_tool.invoke, file_path="protected/example.txt", text="Test content"
    )
    print(f"Writing to protected directory: {result1}")

    # Reading non-existent file
    result2 = safe_file_operation(read_tool.invoke, file_path="nonexistent.txt")
    print(f"Reading non-existent file: {result2}")


# Run the demonstrations
demonstrate_file_operations()
```

<pre class="custom">Writing to protected directory: File written successfully to protected/example.txt.
    Reading non-existent file: Error: no such file or directory: nonexistent.txt
</pre>
