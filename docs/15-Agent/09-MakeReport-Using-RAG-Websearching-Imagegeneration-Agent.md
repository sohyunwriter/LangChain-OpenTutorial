## Overview
In this tutorial, we showcase how to use **three different agents** in LangChain to create a comprehensive report. Specifically, we combine:

1. **Web Searching Agent:**  
   - Performs web searches (via a custom tool) to gather additional real-time information.  

2. **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) Agent:**  
   - Uses a local PDF (e.g., Tesla-related) loaded and chunked into a VectorStore.  
   - Provides relevant context from the PDF using retrieval tools.  

3. **Image Generation Agent:**  
   - Utilizes the **DALL·E** tool to generate images based on text prompts.  

These agents collect data from a PDF, supplement it with web search results, and enrich the final report with generated images, all while demonstrating **streaming outputs** in real time.

By the end of this tutorial, you will learn how to:

- **Integrate** multiple agents (Web Searching, RAG, Image Generation) in a single **LangChain** pipeline.
- **Generate** and **update** a Markdown report (report.md and report-final.md) using the agents’ outputs.
- **Observe** and process streaming outputs using a **custom generator** and **callback** system.

<pre class="custom">True</pre>



## Implementing Multiple Agents

In the following sections, we set up a **LangChain** pipeline with three different agents:
1. **Web Searching Agent** to gather live data,
2. **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) Agent** to pull context from a PDF,
3. **Image Generation Agent** for creating a final image.

We will demonstrate how each agent can be combined to generate a streaming report with real-time parsing and callback-driven outputs.


### Adding a Web Searching Agent

Below, we import a sample tool `TavilySearchResults` for performing web searches. 
This will serve as our **Web Searching Agent** to gather real-time information 
based on user queries.

To use the Tavily Search API, you need to obtain an API key.

- You can obtain your API key by visiting the following link: [Tavily Search API Registration](https://app.tavily.com/home).

You can set `TAVILY_API_KEY` in `.env` file and load it. 

[Note] This is not necessary if you've already set `TAVILY_API_KEY` in previous steps.

```python
import os

# Set the environment variable directly
os.environ["TAVILY_API_KEY"] = "tvly-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"

# Access the API key
print(f"Tavily API Key: {os.getenv('TAVILY_API_KEY')}")
```

```python
from langchain_community.tools.tavily_search import TavilySearchResults

# Create an instance of TavilySearchResults with k=6 for retrieving up to 6 search results
search = TavilySearchResults(k=6)
```

### Data Loading and Vector Store (RAG)

Next, we set up the **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) Agent**. 
Below, we load a PDF file (e.g., shsconf_icdeba2023_02022.pdf), split it into chunks, 
and create a **VectorStore** using **FAISS**. We then initialize a **retriever** 
to query those chunks.

Document Used for Practice  

**Tesla's Revenue Forecast Based on Business Model and Financial Statement Analysis**  

**Author:** Chenhao Fang  
**Institution:** Intelligent Accounting Management Institute, Guangdong University of Finance and Economics  
**Link:** [Tesla's revenue forecast base on business model and financial statement analysis ](https://www.shs-conferences.org/articles/shsconf/pdf/2024/01/shsconf_icdeba2023_02022.pdf)  
**File Name:** shsconf_icdeba2023_02022.pdf

_Please copy the downloaded file to the data folder for practice._  


```python
from langchain_text_splitters import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter
from langchain_community.vectorstores import FAISS
from langchain_openai import OpenAIEmbeddings
from langchain_community.document_loaders import PyMuPDFLoader

# Example PDF file path (modify according to your environment)
pdf_file_path = "data/shsconf_icdeba2023_02022.pdf"

# Load the PDF using PyMuPDFLoader
loader = PyMuPDFLoader(pdf_file_path)

# Split text into smaller chunks
text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=100)
split_docs = loader.load_and_split(text_splitter)

# Create FAISS VectorStore
vector = FAISS.from_documents(split_docs, OpenAIEmbeddings())

# Create a retriever from the VectorStore
retriever = vector.as_retriever()
```

### Wrapping the Retriever as a Tool

We wrap our **retriever** in a LangChain tool so it can be invoked by an agent. 
Here, we define a prompt template to format the retrieved documents.


```python
from langchain_core.tools.retriever import create_retriever_tool
from langchain_core.prompts import PromptTemplate

document_prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template(
    "<document><content>{page_content}</content><page>{page}</page><filename>{source}</filename></document>"
)

retriever_tool = create_retriever_tool(
    retriever,
    name="pdf_search",
    description="use this tool to search for information in Tesla PDF file",
    document_prompt=document_prompt,
)
```

### Adding a DALL·E Tool for Image Generation

Below, we set up the **Image Generation Agent** using `DallEAPIWrapper`. 
This allows our pipeline to generate images based on text prompts 
and integrate them into the final report.


```python
from langchain_community.utilities.dalle_image_generator import DallEAPIWrapper
from langchain_core.tools import tool

dalle = DallEAPIWrapper(
    model="dall-e-3",  # DALL·E model version
    size="1024x1024",  # Image size
    quality="standard",  # Image quality
    n=1,  # Number of images to generate
)


@tool
def dalle_tool(query: str) -> str:
    """Use this tool to generate an image from text"""
    return dalle.run(query)
```

### File Management Tools

Next, we set up file management tools to enable the agent to write, read, 
and list files within a specified directory. This is used to store 
and update the report.md, report-final.md, and other files.


```python
from langchain_community.agent_toolkits import FileManagementToolkit

working_directory = "tmp"

file_tools = FileManagementToolkit(
    root_dir=str(working_directory),
    selected_tools=["write_file", "read_file", "list_directory"],
).get_tools()
```

### Combining Tools

We now combine all tools (Web Searching, RAG, DALL·E, File Management) 
into a single list.

```python
tools = file_tools + [
    retriever_tool,  # PDF search (RAG)
    search,  # Web search
    dalle_tool,  # Image generation
]
tools
```




<pre class="custom">[WriteFileTool(root_dir='tmp'),
     ReadFileTool(root_dir='tmp'),
     ListDirectoryTool(root_dir='tmp'),
     Tool(name='pdf_search', description='use this tool to search for information in Tesla PDF file', args_schema=<class 'langchain_core.tools.retriever.RetrieverInput'>, func=functools.partial(<function _get_relevant_documents at 0x0000024611FB99E0>, retriever=VectorStoreRetriever(tags=['FAISS', 'OpenAIEmbeddings'], vectorstore=<langchain_community.vectorstores.faiss.FAISS object at 0x000002462904FC50>, search_kwargs={}), document_prompt=PromptTemplate(input_variables=['page', 'page_content', 'source'], input_types={}, partial_variables={}, template='<document><content>{page_content}</content><page>{page}</page><filename>{source}</filename></document>'), document_separator='\n\n'), coroutine=functools.partial(<function _aget_relevant_documents at 0x00000246122F5120>, retriever=VectorStoreRetriever(tags=['FAISS', 'OpenAIEmbeddings'], vectorstore=<langchain_community.vectorstores.faiss.FAISS object at 0x000002462904FC50>, search_kwargs={}), document_prompt=PromptTemplate(input_variables=['page', 'page_content', 'source'], input_types={}, partial_variables={}, template='<document><content>{page_content}</content><page>{page}</page><filename>{source}</filename></document>'), document_separator='\n\n')),
     TavilySearchResults(api_wrapper=TavilySearchAPIWrapper(tavily_api_key=SecretStr('**********'))),
     StructuredTool(name='dalle_tool', description='Use this tool to generate an image from text', args_schema=<class 'langchain_core.utils.pydantic.dalle_tool'>, func=<function dalle_tool at 0x000002467EE4ADE0>)]</pre>



### Creating a Prompt and Agent

Here, we create a `ChatPromptTemplate` and a `LangChain` agent to handle 
LLM calls and tool usage. We store each session’s chat history in a dictionary 
to maintain context across multiple steps.



```python
from langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate
from langchain_core.runnables.history import RunnableWithMessageHistory
from langchain.agents import create_tool_calling_agent, AgentExecutor
from langchain_community.chat_message_histories import ChatMessageHistory
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

store = {}

prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages(
    [
        (
            "system",
            "You are a helpful assistant. "
            "You are a professional researcher. "
            "You can use the pdf_search tool to search for information in the Tesla PDF file. "
            "You can find further information by using search tool. "
            "You can use image generation tool to generate image from text. "
            "Finally, you can use file management tool to save your research result into files.",
        ),
        ("placeholder", "{chat_history}"),
        ("human", "{input}"),
        ("placeholder", "{agent_scratchpad}"),
    ]
)

llm = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o")

agent = create_tool_calling_agent(llm, tools, prompt)

agent_executor = AgentExecutor(
    agent=agent,
    tools=tools,
    verbose=False,
    handle_parsing_errors=True,
)


def get_session_history(session_ids):
    if session_ids not in store:
        store[session_ids] = ChatMessageHistory()
    return store[session_ids]


agent_with_chat_history = RunnableWithMessageHistory(
    agent_executor,
    get_session_history,
    input_messages_key="input",
    history_messages_key="chat_history",
)
```

### Synchronous Parsing

Below, we define callbacks to monitor and process the agent’s steps in real time. 
They capture **tool calls**, **observations**, and **final results**.


```python
from langchain_core.agents import AgentAction, AgentStep
from langchain.agents.output_parsers.tools import ToolAgentAction

from typing import Any, Dict, List, Callable
from dataclasses import dataclass


# Callback for tool calls
def tool_callback(tool) -> None:
    print("[Tool Called]")
    print(f"Tool: {tool.get('tool')}")
    if tool_input := tool.get("tool_input"):
        for k, v in tool_input.items():
            print(f"{k}: {v}")
    print(f"Log: {tool.get('log')}")


# Callback for observations
def observation_callback(observation) -> None:
    print("[Observation]")
    print(f"Observation: {observation.get('observation')}")


# Callback for final result
def result_callback(result: str) -> None:
    print("[Final Answer]")
    print(result)


@dataclass
class AgentCallbacks:
    tool_callback: Callable[[Dict[str, Any]], None] = tool_callback
    observation_callback: Callable[[Dict[str, Any]], None] = observation_callback
    result_callback: Callable[[str], None] = result_callback


class AgentStreamParser:
    """
    A class to parse and handle streaming output from the agent.
    """

    def __init__(self, callbacks: AgentCallbacks = AgentCallbacks()):
        """Initialize the AgentStreamParser with custom callbacks."""
        self.callbacks = callbacks
        self.output = None

    def process_agent_steps(self, step: Dict[str, Any]) -> None:
        """Process each step in the agent's output."""
        if "actions" in step:
            self._process_actions(step["actions"])
        elif "steps" in step:
            self._process_observations(step["steps"])
        elif "output" in step:
            self._process_result(step["output"])

    def _process_actions(self, actions: List[Any]) -> None:
        """Handle each tool action detected."""
        for action in actions:
            if isinstance(action, (AgentAction, ToolAgentAction)) and hasattr(
                action, "tool"
            ):
                self._process_tool_call(action)

    def _process_tool_call(self, action: Any) -> None:
        """Handle logic for a single tool call."""
        tool_action = {
            "tool": getattr(action, "tool", None),
            "tool_input": getattr(action, "tool_input", None),
            "log": getattr(action, "log", None),
        }
        self.callbacks.tool_callback(tool_action)

    def _process_observations(self, observations: List[Any]) -> None:
        """Handle the observations produced by the agent."""
        for observation in observations:
            observation_dict = {}
            if isinstance(observation, AgentStep):
                observation_dict["observation"] = getattr(
                    observation, "observation", None
                )
            self.callbacks.observation_callback(observation_dict)

    def _process_result(self, result: str) -> None:
        """Handle the final result from the agent."""
        self.callbacks.result_callback(result)
        self.output = result


# Create the stream parser
agent_stream_parser = AgentStreamParser()
```

## Using the Agent in a Streaming Workflow

Now, we will demonstrate how to use all three agents (**Web Searching**, **RAG**, and **Image Generation**) 
in a **streaming** fashion. Each step is processed by our custom parser, 
allowing us to see **tool calls**, **observations**, and **final answers** in real time.


### Step 1: Summarize PDF Content and Save to report.md

First, we instruct the agent to summarize key aspects of the Tesla PDF and save the summary to report.md.

```python
# This cell asks the agent to summarize certain aspects of the Tesla PDF,
# then writes them to 'report.md' and reads the file contents.

query_1 = (
    "Please find key information about Tesla's financial status and revenue outlook in the Tesla PDF. "
    "Write the summary in English. "
    "Then create a new file `report.md` and save the summary there.\n\n"
    "#Instructions:\n"
    "1. Write an appropriate header (Markdown heading level 2).\n"
    "2. Include the PDF page numbers and file name in parentheses (e.g., page 10, filename.pdf).\n"
    "3. Provide organized bullet points.\n"
    "4. After writing, save the file as `report.md`.\n"
    "5. Finally, read the `report.md` file and display its content.\n"
)

result_1 = agent_with_chat_history.stream(
    {"input": query_1}, config={"configurable": {"session_id": "tesla_session_1"}}
)

print("=== 1) Agent Execution Result ===")
for step in result_1:
    agent_stream_parser.process_agent_steps(step)
```

    Abstract. With the rapid development of the electric vehicle industry, Tesla, as the benchmark of this industry, 
    has been studied by many companies in the same industry and investors outside the industry. Based on Tesla's 
    financial reports in recent years and news about Tesla, Tesla's assets, liabilities, and owner's equity are analyzed 
    to analyze Tesla's basic financial situation, from this, it can be concluded that Tesla's asset-liability ratio and 
    other financial trends have changed in recent years. Then analyze Tesla's business model from the aspects of 
    corporate positioning, business type, and profit model, so, in recent years, Tesla's main profit models, income</content><page>0</page><filename>data/shsconf_icdeba2023_02022.pdf</filename></document>

    year. With a penetration rate of 2.1%, the global sales 
    volume of automobiles in 2018 exceeded 2 million. China, 
    the USA, Germany, France, Sweden, Japan, and other 
    nations account for a large portion of the world's new energy 
    market [3]. If you want to predict the future development of 
    the electric vehicle industry, you can speculate by predicting 
    Tesla's future financial situation. This study hopes to 
    provide some insight into the future forecast of the electric 
    vehicle industry by predicting Tesla's future financial 
    situation. In this research, common-size financial statements 
    and ratio analysis are used. Start with Tesla's basic financial 
    situation, then analyze Tesla's business model, and finally 
    predict Tesla's future financial situation.

    margin will fluctuate with changes in capacity, sales volume, 
    scale effect, and amortized production costs.. 
    In 2020, Tesla produced a total of 1,369,600 vehicles 
    worldwide and delivered a total of 1,313,900 vehicles, +40% 
    year-on-year, slightly below the 50% growth target set at the 
    beginning of 22 years. 
    Number of vehicle sales are expected to reach 1.8 
    million units in 23 years, approximately +35% y/y. 
    Combined with a forecast for the number of Tesla electric 
    vehicle deliveries, we can predict Tesla's future revenue. 
    6 Conclusion 
    Fig. 1. Revenue forecast. 
    Figure 1 shows Tesla's future revenue. So, Tesla's forecast 
    profit is $71.4 billion in 2023, $84.6 billion in 2024, and 
    $131.2 billion in 2025. Based on the average price of Tesla 
    in 23 years of $47,000, the revenue of the electric vehicle 
    business in 23 years is estimated to be 84.6 billion US 
    dollars, +18% year-on-year. Assuming a vehicle price of</content><page>4</page><filename>data/shsconf_icdeba2023_02022.pdf</filename></document>

    $45,000 and $43,000 in 24 and '25, by 2025, the revenue 
    from electric vehicle sales will be about $130 billion, +80% 
    from '22. All of this is based on an analysis of Tesla's 
    existing assets and liabilities and business model. This study 
    predicts Tesla's income in the next few years. It is certain 
    that Tesla's income will continue to grow in the next few 
    years, which may help some investors related to Tesla in 
    terms of investment. However, since Tesla discloses less 
    economic information to the outside world, and the research 
    method of this paper is relatively simple, the information 
    that can be provided is limited. In future studies, researchers 
    can use more diverse and accurate methods to predict 
    Tesla's income.

### Step 4: Generate and Embed an Image into report-final.md

Finally, we generate an image symbolizing Tesla’s future using the **Image Generation Agent**, 
and prepend the image URL to report-final.md.


```python
# This cell generates an image symbolizing Tesla’s future using the dalle_tool,
# and then prepends the image URL to 'report-final.md'.

query_4 = (
    "Please open `report-final.md` and display its content. "
    "Then generate an image representing Tesla's future using dalle_tool. "
    "Add the image URL to the top of the final report in Markdown format. "
    "Finally, save the updated report in `report-final.md` again."
)

result_4 = agent_with_chat_history.stream(
    {"input": query_4}, config={"configurable": {"session_id": "tesla_session_1"}}
)

print("=== 4) Agent Execution Result ===")
for step in result_4:
