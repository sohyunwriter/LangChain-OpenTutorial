## Overview

**Agentic RAG** extends traditional RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) systems by incorporating an agent-based approach for more sophisticated information retrieval and response generation. This system goes beyond simple document retrieval and response generation by enabling agents to utilize various tools for more intelligent information processing. These tools include `Tavily Search` for accessing up-to-date information, `Python` code execution capabilities, and custom function implementations, all integrated within the `LangChain` framework to provide a comprehensive solution for information processing and generation tasks.

This tutorial demonstrates how to build a document retrieval system using `FAISS DB` for effective PDF document processing and searching. Using the AI Brief from the Software Policy Research Institute as an example document, we'll explore how to integrate web-based document loaders, text splitters, vector stores, and `OpenAI` embeddings to create a practical **Agentic RAG** system. The implementation showcases how the `Retriever` tool can be effectively combined with various `LangChain` components to create a robust document search and response generation pipeline.

##  Configuring Tools

The foundational stage of setting up tools for the agent to use. We implement a web search tool using the `Tavily Search API` and a PDF document retrieval tool. These tools enable the agent to effectively search and utilize information from various sources. By combining these tools, the agent can select and use the appropriate tool based on the context.

### Implementing Web Search

The web search tool utilizes the `Tavily Search API` to retrieve real-time information from the web. It returns up to 6 results ranked by relevance, with each result containing a URL and content snippet.

```python
from langchain_community.tools.tavily_search import TavilySearchResults

# Create a search tool instance that returns up to 6 results
search = TavilySearchResults(k=6)
```

```python
# Example usage
result = search.invoke("When was the movie A.I. released and who is the director?")
print(result)
```

Plus, quite a few critics in America misunderstood the film, thinking for instance that the Giacometti-style beings in the final 20 minutes were aliens (whereas they were robots of the future who had evolved themselves from the robots in the earlier part of the film) and also thinking that the final 20 minutes were a sentimental addition by Spielberg, whereas those scenes were exactly what I wrote for Stanley and exactly what he wanted, filmed faithfully by Spielberg. However, Spielberg asked Angel to be on the set every day to make line alterations wherever he felt necessary.[32] Social robotics expert Cynthia Breazeal served as technical consultant during production.[21][33] Costume designer Bob Ringwood studied pedestrians on the Las Vegas Strip for his influence on the Rouge City extras.[34] Additional visual effects such as removing the visible rods controlling Teddy and removing Haley Joel Osment\'s breath, were provided in-house by PDI/DreamWorks.[35]\nCasting[edit]\nJulianne Moore and Gwyneth Paltrow were considered for the role of Monica Swinton before Frances O\'Connor was cast and Jerry Seinfeld was originally considered to voice and play the Comedian Robot before Chris Rock was cast.[36]\nSoundtrack[edit]\n To avoid audiences mistaking A.I. for a family film, no action figures were created, although Hasbro released a talking Teddy following the film\'s release in June 2001.[21]\nA.I. premiered at the Venice Film Festival in 2001.[38]\nHome media[edit]\nA.I.

### Implementing PDF Search

This tutorial demonstrates how to build a PDF search tool that leverages vector databases for efficient document retrieval. The system divides PDF documents into manageable chunks and utilizes `OpenAI` embeddings for text vectorization alongside `FAISS` for fast similarity searching.

For this tutorial, we'll work with a sample document from the academic text "*An Introduction to Ethics in Robotics and AI*" (2021). This comprehensive book explores fundamental concepts including AI definitions, machine learning principles, robotics fundamentals, and the current limitations of AI technology.

- Title: What Is AI?
- Authors:
    - Christoph Bartneck (University of Canterbury)
    - Christoph Lütge (Technical University of Munich)
- File: [What_is_AI.pdf](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/343611353_What_Is_AI)

To begin, please place the PDF file in your data directory.

```python
from langchain_text_splitters import RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter
from langchain_community.vectorstores import FAISS
from langchain_openai import OpenAIEmbeddings
from langchain.document_loaders import PyPDFLoader
from langchain.tools.retriever import create_retriever_tool

# Load and process the PDF
loader = PyPDFLoader("data/What_Is_AI.pdf")

# Create text splitter
text_splitter = RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter(chunk_size=1000, chunk_overlap=100)

# Split the document
split_docs = loader.load_and_split(text_splitter)

# Create vector store
vector = FAISS.from_documents(split_docs, OpenAIEmbeddings())

# Create retriever
retriever = vector.as_retriever()

# Create retriever tool
retriever_tool = create_retriever_tool(
    retriever,
    name="pdf_search",
    description="use this tool to search information from the PDF document",
)
```

```python
retriever.invoke("What are the main limitations of AI discussed in the text?")
```

### Combining Tools

We combine multiple tools into a single list, allowing the agent to select and use the appropriate tool based on the context. This enables flexible switching between web search and document retrieval.

```python
# Combine tools into a single list for the agent to use
tools = [search, retriever_tool]
```

## Building the Agent

The core stage of building an agent. We initialize a Large Language Model (LLM) and set up prompt templates that enable the agent to effectively utilize tools. The agent is configured to combine PDF search and web search capabilities, allowing it to find answers from various information sources. Specifically, we use `create_tool_calling_agent` to create an agent with tool-using capabilities and explain how to set up the execution environment using `AgentExecutor`.

```python
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
from langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate
from langchain.agents import create_tool_calling_agent, AgentExecutor

# Initialize LLM
llm = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o", temperature=0)

# Define prompt template
prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages(
    [
        (
            "system",
            "You are a helpful assistant. "
            "Make sure to use the `pdf_search` tool for searching information from the PDF document. "
            "If you can't find the information from the PDF document, use the `search` tool for searching information from the web.",
        ),
        ("placeholder", "{chat_history}"),
        ("human", "{input}"),
        ("placeholder", "{agent_scratchpad}"),
    ]
)

# Create agent
agent = create_tool_calling_agent(llm, tools, prompt)

# Create agent executor
agent_executor = AgentExecutor(agent=agent, tools=tools, verbose=False)
```

> *Note*: We set `verbose=False` to suppress intermediate step outputs from the agent executor.


## Implementing Chat History

The essential implementation stage for managing conversation history. We implement a session-based chat history store that allows the agent to remember and reference previous conversations. Using `ChatMessageHistory`, we maintain independent conversation histories for each session, and through `RunnableWithMessageHistory`, we enable the agent to understand conversation context and maintain natural dialogue flow. This allows users to ask follow-up questions naturally based on previous interactions.

```python
from langchain_community.chat_message_histories import ChatMessageHistory
from langchain_core.runnables.history import RunnableWithMessageHistory

# Create a store for session histories
store = {}


def get_session_history(session_ids):
    if session_ids not in store:
        store[session_ids] = ChatMessageHistory()
    return store[session_ids]


# Create agent with chat history
agent_with_chat_history = RunnableWithMessageHistory(
    agent_executor,
    get_session_history,
    input_messages_key="input",
    history_messages_key="chat_history",
)
```

## Running Examples

Introduction to running the implemented agent and examining its results. Using streaming output, we can observe the agent's thought process and results in real-time. Through various examples, we showcase the agent's core functionalities including PDF document search, web search, independent session management across conversations, and response restructuring. The `process_response` function helps structure the agent's responses, clearly showing tool usage and results in an organized manner.

```python
def process_response(response):
    """
    Process and display streaming response from the agent.

    Args:
        response: Agent's streaming response iterator
    """
    for chunk in response:
        if chunk.get("output"):
            print(chunk["output"])
        elif chunk.get("actions"):
            for action in chunk["actions"]:
                print(f"\nTool Used: {action.tool}")
                print(f"Tool Input: {action.tool_input}")
                if action.log:
                    print(f"Tool Log: {action.log}")
```

```python
# Example 1: Searching in PDF
response = agent_with_chat_history.stream(
    {
        "input": "What information can you find about Samsung's AI model in the document?"
    },
    config={"configurable": {"session_id": "tutorial_session_1"}},
)
process_response(response)
```

    Samsung has recently unveiled its new generative AI model called Samsung Gauss. This model was introduced at the Samsung AI Forum 2023. Named after the mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss, the model signifies the infinite possibilities of generative AI that Samsung aims to realize. Samsung Gauss is designed to improve performance and efficiency, and it will be used to enhance Galaxy AI features. It is also capable of generating text, code, and images, positioning it as a potential alternative to models like ChatGPT. The development of Samsung Gauss was led by Samsung Research.

    Tool Log: 
    Invoking: `pdf_search` with `{'query': 'Strong and Weak AI'}`
    
    
    
    The PDF document discusses the concepts of Strong and Weak AI as follows:
    
    - **Weak AI**: This type of AI is limited to a single, narrowly defined task. Most modern AI systems fall into this category. They are developed to handle a specific problem, task, or issue and generally cannot solve other problems, even if they are related. Examples of weak AI include systems that can beat a grandmaster in chess or Go, or experienced players in Poker.
    
    - **Strong AI**: In contrast, Strong AI is defined by John Searle as an AI that, when appropriately programmed with the right inputs and outputs, would have a mind in exactly the same sense human beings have minds. This implies that Strong AI would have the ability to understand, reason, and have consciousness similar to humans. As of the document's writing, no AI system has achieved Strong AI.
    
    The document also mentions that while some software systems have claimed to pass the Turing test, these claims are disputed, and no AI system has yet achieved Strong AI.

```python
# Example 4: Request to summarize previous response in a table (Session 2)
